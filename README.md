We'll be using the app to target new language learners. 

The concept is this, we'll have something recording the person's speach all day.

At the end of the day, his speech will be broken into sentences (we could parse the grammar)

Additionally, the user could then review the words that were incorrectly recorded and have it added as a wrong word.
Stats could be shown for wrong or right words so the user could compare and view his stats.
